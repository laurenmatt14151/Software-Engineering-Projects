### calculator.py
User provides an expression and program returns the result

Possible Improvements
<li>Handle parenthesis</li>
<li>Invalid characters in expression: If the user enters characters other than digits</li>
<li>Multiple decimal points: Could add check to ensure that each number in the expression has at most one decimal</li>
<li>empty expression</li>
<li>Invalid arithmetic expression: If 2 operators are placed next to eachother</li>
<li>Large numbers: using a library or custom logic to handle large numbers</li>
<li>Too complex: Too many nested parameters</li>

### budget_tracker.py
